		<h1>A little look inside me</h1>
		<article>
		<h2>Painted walls with blood and ink</h2>
		<p>With everything gone i still think about everything that torned us apart... together apart,<br> Nothing will erase this things from my head, nothing will heal the big whole that you left me in.<br> What can a simple mortal do...? nothing but look at it and smile, smile while i can.<br> This aint a goodbye neither something close to one <em>see you later</em> <br> This is just me talking to that wall painted with blood and ink.</p>

		<p>Can we discuss something about our past? something so burried inside ourself that not even our brightest psicologist could bring it up?<br>unseen by this rooted society, by this heartless people? can we make it up to all these years lost in our thoughts?<br> I believe not... there's nothing to remember, there's nothing to heal... you take it all you stole from me everything you could imagine and more.<br> Dont tell me now that you going to regret for taking take a step away to breath... cuz you take the only thing that i wanted to breathe.<br> And it was you the one who left... the one who make this... together apart.<br> Together apart...

				Twisted like a twister.

					<p><p>There is a bit of me in you, and there's a bit of you in everything i can think of.<br>There's a meaning between lines... you just have to be carefull to read'em right.<br>With all the will to live our life we just walk right directly to our certain death.<br>i told someone that i didn't love you at all, then they asked me if i have missed you? and i told them... <em>I still try</em><br> a Twisted mind like myself will always have something to say.</p>
